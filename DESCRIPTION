Description: ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the
    amazing ggplot2 package. Hence the blanket metaphor. The primary objective 
    of the package is to help users make beautiful ggplot2 visualisation 
    simpler. A secondary objective is to help users build intuition for ggplot2, 
     such that they can move between the two packages as needed.
