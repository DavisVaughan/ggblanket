Description: ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the
    amazing ggplot2 package. Hence the blanket metaphor in the package
    name. The primary objective of the package is to help users make
    beautiful ggplot2 visualisation with less code and cognitive load. A 
    secondary objective is to help users build intuition for ggplot2, such that 
    they can move between ggplot2 and ggblanket as needed.
