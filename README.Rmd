## Overview

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the amazing ggplot2 package. 

Hence the blanket metaphor in the package name. 

The primary objective of the package is to help users make beautiful ggplot2 visualisation with less code and cognitive load. 

A secondary objective is to help users build intuition for ggplot2, such that they can move between ggplot2 and ggblanket as needed.   

With these objectives in mind, the ggblanket package:

* uses quick functions that wrap around a single geom
* merges col and fill aesthetics together into a single col aesthetic
* provides colour customisation via a pal argument
* treats faceting as an aesthetic
* pushes x and y limits to the max of the x and y breaks by default
* arranges horizontal geom y and col labels etc to be in correct order 
* makes titles and labels sentence case and comma format by default 
* provides arguments for scale adjustment and legend placement
* changes default colours, alphas, widths and themes 
* allows users to access all other non-aesthetic geom functionality 
* keeps all stat and position arguments consistent with the applicable geom's
