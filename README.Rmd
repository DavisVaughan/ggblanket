## Overview

ggblanket is a package of wrapper functions around the incredible ggplot2 package.

The primary objective is to **simplify visualisation** for users.

Secondary objectives are:

* scope: cover >90% of what ggplot2 does
* design: produce well-designed visualisation by default
* alignment: use conventions generally aligned with ggplot2 

It is intended to be useful for all levels of experience from beginners all the way to expert ggplot-ers.

  gg_histogram(x = flipper_length_mm,
               col = sex,
